This is a midbootcamp data analysis project  for Iron Hack, November 2022.
It's using a data from an open source: 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit/code?resource=download
The data was provided by FitBit to help the BellaBeat to find out answers on these business questions:
What are some trends in smart device usage?
How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?
How could these trends help inï¬‚uence Bellabeat marketing strategy?
I found a lot of connection in customers behavior, we have better vision when people are more active, what helps them to burn calories.
The next step could be to have wider data set, with more information about age, gender, geolocation, weight, height.
As the data was given in 2016 there is a big chance that provided information is less valuble, after corona pandemic people could change their patterns of behavior.
